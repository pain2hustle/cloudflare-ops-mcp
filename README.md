# AMH Cloudflare Ops MCP by WT

**An approval-gated Cloudflare operations suite with an optional private Agent Harness: bounded delegation, deterministic verification, OAuth-isolated MCP tools, and verified deploy checks without handing agents raw account credentials.**

- **Private Agent Harness:** Jack-friendly reusable agent profiles, bounded research and independent verification, automatic schedules, compact continuity briefings, and a live operator console for jobs, handoffs, limits, and redacted logs.
- **SafeTry controls:** read-only defaults, explicit approvals, narrow adapters instead of a generic shell, tenant isolation, retention limits, and a tamper-evident audit chain.
- **Verified deploy gate:** checks the public target for an explicit 2xx status, rejects redirects, and optionally requires an expected release marker before reporting success.
- **Deterministic site health:** zero-AI HTTP checks remain useful for small valid pages and can require an expected text marker to catch a 200 response serving the wrong site.
- **Self-catching email loopback:** exercises the configured sending/routing path and records delivery evidence; it does not claim to prove placement in a provider's inbox tab.
- **Cloudflare-native connections:** optional OAuth connectors for the official Cloudflare API, Workers Builds, Bindings, Observability, and Docs MCP services, plus Wrangler-based Worker deployment and secrets.
- **Guarded operations:** Turnstile, DNS, SPF/DMARC/BIMI, Email Routing, Pages cutovers, cache purge, scoped tokens, and account diagnostics stay dry-run or approval-gated where they write.

Cloudflare Ops MCP scans Cloudflare configuration, computes a **diff** of desired vs current **DNS / Email Routing / BIMI / DMARC / SPF / Pages / cache / Turnstile** setup, and **applies fixes only after explicit approval**. It is built for people who want an AI agent to help with Cloudflare safely: scan first, show the plan, then write only when the owner approves.

Version 0.4.2 works five ways:

- **CLI**: run `cfops` locally with a scoped Cloudflare token.
- **Library**: import the zero-dependency engine into your own app.
- **Hosted OAuth MCP**: connect your own Cloudflare account and receive a one-user `cfops_` connector key. The owner's API token is never shared.
- **Self-hosted MCP Worker**: deploy the included Worker with Wrangler for your own team or infrastructure.
- **Private Agent Harness**: deploy the companion `agent/` Worker behind the MCP Worker's `AGENT_HARNESS` service binding for bounded jobs, health watches, schedules, audit, and the authenticated operator console.

For repository-connected deployments, see [GIT-INTEGRATION.md](GIT-INTEGRATION.md). The recommended route uses Cloudflare Workers Builds' GitHub App authorization; the MCP does not store a GitHub token.

Cloudflare Ops MCP is especially useful for Cloudflare operators who need repeatable DNS hygiene across many zones: SPF cleanup, DMARC enforcement, BIMI records, MX checks, DKIM discovery, Cloudflare Email Routing, TXT verification records, safe DNS upserts, and audit logs for every approved write.

> **Unofficial Cloudflare tool.** Cloudflare Ops MCP is made by **AMH - Artificial Mind Hive**, operated by **Service Pricer LLC**. It is independent, third-party, open-source software. It is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, or made by Cloudflare, Inc.** "Cloudflare" and "Wrangler" are referenced only to describe compatibility with Cloudflare's platform and official developer tooling. You are responsible for every DNS, Email Routing, DMARC, BIMI, SPF, or Worker change you approve and apply.

> **No owner's API key in Git or in your client.** Public users authorize Cloudflare directly. OAuth access and refresh tokens stay server-side in KV; the connector key is stored only as a SHA-256 hash and is bound to one OAuth grant.

---

## What Cloudflare Ops MCP handles

Cloudflare Ops MCP is focused on the Cloudflare tasks that regularly break launches, email trust, bot checks, cache freshness, brand display, and AI-agent workflows:

- DNS record scan, lookup, create, update, no-op detection, and guarded delete.
- SPF detection and planning so you do not accidentally create multiple SPF records.
- DMARC parsing and policy updates that only change the fields you asked for.
- BIMI TXT setup with a DMARC enforcement gate.
- DKIM discovery so the report can tell whether sender keys exist.
- MX and Cloudflare Email Routing checks.
- Email Routing destination/rule setup with verified-destination protection.
- Audit logs for applied changes.
- Cloudflare Pages DNS cutovers and cache purge operations.
- Turnstile widget planning/creation for bot checks.
- MCP endpoint deployment on Cloudflare Workers with Wrangler secrets.
- AI-agent safety defaults: dry-run first, diff display, no token in tool args, no accidental deletes.

This is not meant to replace every Cloudflare feature. It is the narrow, safe lane for common Cloudflare ops an operator or AI agent should be allowed to do.

## Examples are operator recipes

The examples below are intentionally direct. They are not toy examples. They show the exact dry-run -> review -> apply pattern users should follow when fixing real domains.

### Cloudflare Pages DNS cutover

Use this when an old registrar, parking page, Vercel app, HugeDomains page, or stale A/AAAA records are blocking a Cloudflare Pages custom domain.

Dry-run first:

```sh
cfops pages example.com --target project.pages.dev
```

Apply only after reviewing the delete/create plan:

```sh
cfops pages example.com --target project.pages.dev --apply
```

What it changes:

- Deletes conflicting apex A/AAAA/CNAME records.
- Deletes conflicting www A/AAAA/CNAME records and www NS delegations.
- Adds proxied CNAME records for apex and www pointing at the Pages target.
- Leaves TXT, MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, BIMI, and other delegated subdomains alone.
- Leaves wildcard records alone unless you explicitly add `--wildcard`.

Options:

- `--no-www` only cuts over the apex domain.
- `--wildcard` also removes conflicting `*.example.com` A/AAAA/CNAME records.


## Why build this with Wrangler?

Wrangler is Cloudflare's official developer CLI. Cloudflare Ops MCP can run without Wrangler as a local CLI/library, but Wrangler is the right path when you want a remote MCP server because it deploys the Worker, stores secrets, tails logs, and manages Cloudflare bindings from the same toolchain Cloudflare documents.

Use Wrangler when you want:

- a hosted MCP endpoint for agents and teammates;
- server-side OAuth client secrets and optional private admin fallback secrets;
- Cloudflare Pages/Workers deployment checks;
- observability through Cloudflare logs;
- a repeatable production setup instead of local-only scripts.

Use the plain CLI when you only need one local terminal to scan or fix a zone.

## Current release notes

<table>
<tr>
<td>

**Agent-safe Cloudflare writes**

Cloudflare Ops MCP keeps the write path narrow: scan the target, show the diff, wait for explicit approval, then apply only the requested DNS, DMARC, BIMI, SPF, Email Routing, Pages, cache, or Turnstile change.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Per-user OAuth isolation**

Public users connect their own Cloudflare account and receive an opaque `cfops_` connector key. Only its hash is stored. Each request resolves to exactly one OAuth grant, user-supplied tenant switching is ignored, refresh tokens remain server-side, and either side can revoke the connection.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Email trust diagnostics**

The scanner reports SPF, DKIM discovery, DMARC policy, BIMI readiness, MX records, and Cloudflare Email Routing status so an agent or operator can see what is missing before touching production DNS.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

**Other highlights**

- Zero-dependency core library for host apps and CLI use.
- Scoped Cloudflare token guidance instead of Global API Key usage.
- Audit logging for applied changes, with token redaction.
- Operator-ready setup docs for CLI, library, and self-hosted MCP use.

## Safety model (the whole point)

1. **Dry-run by default.** Every mutating function takes an options object and
   only writes when `{ apply: true }` is passed. The CLI is dry-run unless you
   add `--apply`. A dry-run returns the *planned* change plus a before/after
   diff and writes nothing.
2. **Scan before write.** Apply paths re-fetch current state and return a
   before/after diff, so you always see exactly what will change.
3. **Never delete as a side effect.** Deleting a DNS record requires an explicit
   `deleteDnsRecord(..., { confirm: true })` call (CLI: `--force`). An `apply`
   never deletes anything.
4. **Token hygiene.** The Cloudflare API token is read **only** from
   `process.env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`. It is never logged, never written to the
   audit log, and never included in thrown error messages - any token-looking
   substring is redacted defensively.
5. **Scoped token only.** Use a least-privilege scoped API token. **Do not use
   the Global API Key.**
6. **BIMI precondition.** `setupBimi` first checks the domain's DMARC policy. If
   `p` is missing or `none`, it **refuses to write in apply mode** (BIMI is not
   honored below enforcement) unless you pass `{ force: true }`. In dry-run it
   warns.
7. **Audit log.** Every apply appends one JSON line to an audit log
   (default `./cloudflare-ops-mcp-audit.log`) with
   `{ ts, action, domain, record, before, after }` - never the token.

---

## Quick setup

For the fastest path, start with [SETUP.md](SETUP.md). It explains the CLI path, the Wrangler-hosted MCP path, and how users provide their own Cloudflare credentials safely. See [PHASES.md](PHASES.md) for the rollout model, [OAUTH.md](OAUTH.md) for hosted Cloudflare OAuth, and [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the next upgrades.

## How a user actually uses it

1. Visit [Connect Cloudflare](https://cfops.nothingunseen.com/oauth/cloudflare/start).
2. Approve the Cloudflare permissions shown on the consent screen.
3. Copy the one-time MCP configuration into Claude, Codex, Cursor, or another Streamable HTTP MCP client.
4. Restart or reconnect the client. It calls MCP `initialize` and `tools/list` automatically—users do not need to memorize tool names.
5. Ask for the outcome in plain language.

Example prompts:

```txt
Scan example.com and explain the DNS and email-auth problems. Do not write anything.

Check DMARC, SPF, DKIM, BIMI, MX, and Cloudflare Email Routing.

Show me a dry-run to move example.com to project.pages.dev. Preserve email records.

Plan a cache purge for these three URLs. Do not apply it.

Apply exactly the change I just approved, then verify the live result.
```

The agent chooses the appropriate MCP tool from its schema. Read-only calls run immediately. Mutation tools return a dry-run diff unless the caller explicitly sends `apply: true`; users should approve only after reading that diff.

Current v0.4 tools cover DNS, email authentication/routing, Pages cutover, cache purge, Turnstile, token operations, and account diagnostics — plus the **AMH WT Agent Harness** (`agent/`): a private companion Worker for bounded research, verification, UI checks, and zero-AI site-health watches. One Durable Object per user keeps a tamper-evident audit chain, friendly reusable agent profiles (Jack is the default office manager), a Continuity Keeper briefing with automatic 4/7/30-day retention, daily model-call limits, schedules, and candidate revisions that never self-apply. The default Free profile uses `@cf/zai-org/glm-4.7-flash` with independent `@cf/google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` verification; `@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6` is labeled and enabled only as an explicit Workers Paid profile. The authenticated console and optional terminal show live handoffs, names, limits, alerts, and exact recorded model calls without spending another inference. Official Cloudflare API, Workers Builds, Bindings, Observability, and Docs MCP connectors use each operator's own OAuth grant. See [AGENT-HARNESS.md](AGENT-HARNESS.md), [CLOUDFLARE-MCP.md](CLOUDFLARE-MCP.md), [MAIL-LANDING-GUIDE.md](MAIL-LANDING-GUIDE.md), and [RELEASE-GATE.md](RELEASE-GATE.md).

## Install

```sh
npm install cloudflare-ops-mcp
# or run the CLI without installing:
npx cloudflare-ops-mcp scan example.com
```

Requires **Node.js >= 18** (for the built-in global `fetch`). No other
dependencies.

---

## Create a scoped Cloudflare API token (least privilege)

1. Cloudflare dashboard -> **My Profile** -> **API Tokens** -> **Create Token**.
2. Choose **Create Custom Token**.
3. Under **Permissions**, add exactly these three:
   - **Zone** -> **Zone** -> **Read**
   - **Zone** -> **DNS** -> **Edit**
   - **Zone** -> **Email Routing Rules** -> **Edit**
4. Under **Zone Resources**, select **Include -> Specific zone ->** *your domain*
   (not "All zones").
5. *(Recommended)* set a **TTL** and/or **Client IP Address Filtering**.
6. **Continue -> Create Token**, then copy the token value **once** (it is shown
   only at creation; if lost, roll it).

> Do **not** use the Global API Key - it has access to everything, cannot be
> scoped or time-limited, and there is only one per account.

### Provide the token

Put it in your environment (never in a CLI argument or in code):

```sh
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your-scoped-token"
```

or copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it in:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# then load it however you prefer (e.g. `set -a; . ./.env; set +a`)
```

`cloudflare-ops-mcp` reads `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` from the environment only.

### Hosted OAuth connector — users never receive the owner's API token

For the public hosted service:

1. Open [https://cfops.nothingunseen.com/oauth/cloudflare/start](https://cfops.nothingunseen.com/oauth/cloudflare/start).
2. Approve only the Cloudflare scopes shown on Cloudflare's consent screen.
3. Copy the one-time `cfops_` connector key from the success page.
4. Put that connector key in your MCP client's `Authorization` header.

The connector key is not a Cloudflare API token. Its SHA-256 hash maps to one server-side OAuth connection, so it cannot select another user's grant. Cloudflare access and refresh tokens never enter Git, chat, an issue, or the MCP tool arguments.

Claude Desktop or Cursor-style configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudflareOps": {
      "url": "https://cfops.nothingunseen.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer cfops_YOUR_CONNECTOR_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Codex CLI:

```sh
codex mcp add cloudflare-ops --url https://cfops.nothingunseen.com/mcp \
  --bearer-token-env-var CFOPS_CONNECTOR_KEY
```

Then set `CFOPS_CONNECTOR_KEY` in your own environment. Do not commit it. See [OAUTH.md](OAUTH.md) for status, revocation, refresh behavior, and self-hosting.
### Public-use credential model

Cloudflare Ops MCP does **not** ship with an API key, shared account, hosted proxy token, or any hidden credentials. Every operator must bring one of these:

- a scoped Cloudflare API token in their own environment for local CLI/library use;
- a scoped Cloudflare API token stored as their own Worker secret for self-hosted MCP use;
- a per-user Cloudflare OAuth connection stored server-side by the Worker for hosted MCP use;
- an OAuth/token-vault integration built by their own host app, with approval gates before writes.

Do not ask users to send tokens through chat, issues, logs, or screenshots. If a token is exposed, rotate it in Cloudflare and create a new scoped token.

---

## The token vending machine (mint down, never up)

Wrangler *consumes* tokens. The official Cloudflare MCP *consumes* tokens. Nothing in the toolchain *manufactures* least-privilege tokens on demand — so everyone ends up doing agent work with one big long-lived key. This is the gap `mint_scoped_token` closes:

1. **You hold one bootstrap token** (needs `User > API Tokens > Edit`). It stays a Worker secret or env var — it never travels through a chat or an agent transcript.
2. **An agent asks for a task token**: `mint_scoped_token { domain: "example.com", preset: "dns-zone", ttl_seconds: 3600 }`. Dry-run first, like every mutating tool here — you see the exact policy JSON before anything is created.
3. **The minted token is confined to ONE zone, with preset permissions, and auto-expires** (default 1 hour, hard-capped at 24 h unless `confirm_long=true`). Presets: `zone-read`, `dns-zone`, `cache-purge`. There is deliberately **no super or account-wide preset** — mint down, never up.
4. **Hand it to whatever does the work** — a cheaper model, a cron job, even Wrangler itself (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<minted> wrangler ...`). When it leaks or lingers, it's a key to one zone's DNS that dies within the hour.
5. `list_tokens` shows what's outstanding (never values), `revoke_token` kills one early.

### Orchestrator + cheap-agent pattern

This is the flow the vending machine is built for: a strong orchestrator model plans, a cheap model executes.

- The orchestrator (Claude, or your pick) decides *what* needs doing and calls `mint_scoped_token` for exactly that scope.
- A cheap tool-calling model (Kimi K2, Groq-hosted Llama, anything OpenAI-compatible) gets the minted token + the MCP endpoint and grinds the routine work — DNS fixes, DMARC rollouts, cache busts — through the same dry-run-gated tools.
- Every mutating call still requires `apply: true`, so the cheap agent's mistakes surface as diffs, not damage.

MCP is model-agnostic by design: any MCP client can point at the hosted Worker endpoint, and any tool-calling LLM can drive that client.

## Doctor tools (the questions Cloudflare makes you assemble by hand)

Read-only diagnostics for the failure modes that actually burn multi-account operators:

- **`who_serves_domain`** — domain → zone → Worker routes, Worker custom domains, and Pages projects that claim it, with a warning when several products fight over one hostname. Answers "what is ACTUALLY serving this URL?" without four dashboard tabs.
- **`account_doctor`** — which accounts this token can see, whether the account you *meant* is among them (wrong-token detection), and same-name Pages projects across accounts — the decoy that lets a deploy "succeed" into the wrong account while production never changes.
- **`pages_branch_check`** — the project's production branch vs the branch you're about to deploy. Catches the silent "git says `master`, project says `main`, every deploy lands on a preview" failure before it eats an afternoon.

## CLI usage

```
cfops <command> <domain> [options]
```

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `scan <domain>` | Full read-only snapshot: DNS, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, BIMI, Email Routing. |
| `plan <domain> [--inbox x@y]` | Report desired vs current email-auth posture (no writes). |
| `dns <domain> --type T --name N --content C [--ttl n] [--proxied] [--apply]` | Upsert a DNS record (create / update / no-op). |
| `email <domain> --forward a@b=to@c [--catch-all to@c] [--apply]` | Plan/apply Email Routing forward rules + catch-all. |
| `dmarc <domain> --policy quarantine [--rua mailto:x] [--pct 25] [--apply]` | Change **only** the DMARC `p=` (and `rua`/`pct`), safely. |
| `bimi <domain> --logo <url> [--vmc <url>] [--apply] [--force]` | Set `default._bimi` TXT (refuses if DMARC=`none` unless `--force`). |
| `verify <domain>` | Verify the API token, then resolve the zone. |

Global flags: `--apply` (perform the write; default is dry-run), `--force`
(BIMI DMARC override / delete), `--audit <path>` (audit log location),
`-h`/`--help`.

**Everything is a dry-run until you add `--apply`.** BIMI needs a **hosted
SVG Tiny-PS logo URL** that you supply via `--logo` (and, for Gmail/Apple Mail
display, a VMC/CMC via `--vmc`).

---

## Worked example - three real jobs

Assume a scoped token is exported and each domain is a zone in your account.

### (a) Add `default._bimi` TXT to `example.com`

First, dry-run (writes nothing - shows the diff):

```sh
cfops bimi example.com --logo https://example.com/bimi/logo.svg
```

```
BIMI for example.com (DMARC p=quarantine, enforcing=true):
  new record: v=BIMI1; l=https://example.com/bimi/logo.svg
  action: create (dry-run)
  record: TXT default._bimi.example.com
  - before: (record does not exist)
  + after:  content="v=BIMI1; l=https://example.com/bimi/logo.svg" ttl=1
  warn: No VMC/CMC supplied (a=). Gmail and Apple Mail require a VMC/CMC to display the logo; Yahoo/AOL do not.

Dry-run only. Re-run with --apply to write this change.
```

Then apply:

```sh
cfops bimi example.com --logo https://example.com/bimi/logo.svg --apply
```

> If `example.com`'s DMARC were still at `p=none`, the apply would be **blocked**
> with an error telling you to raise DMARC first (or pass `--force`). Fix DMARC,
> then set BIMI.

### (b) Add `default._bimi` TXT to `example.org`

Dry-run:

```sh
cfops bimi example.org --logo https://example.org/bimi/logo.svg
```

Apply once the diff looks right:

```sh
cfops bimi example.org --logo https://example.org/bimi/logo.svg --apply
```

(For broad display in Gmail/Apple Mail, host a VMC/CMC and add
`--vmc https://example.org/bimi/vmc.pem`.)

### (c) Change `_dmarc.example.org` from `p=none` to `p=quarantine`

Dry-run first - note it changes **only** `p`, preserving your existing `rua`:

```sh
cfops dmarc example.org --policy quarantine --rua mailto:dmarc@example.org --pct 25
```

```
DMARC none -> quarantine for example.org:
  new record: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.org; pct=25
  action: update (dry-run)
  record: TXT _dmarc.example.org
  - before: content="\"v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.org\"" ttl=1
  + after:  content="\"v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.org; pct=25\"" ttl=1
  changed fields: content

Dry-run only. Re-run with --apply to write this change.
```

Then apply:

```sh
cfops dmarc example.org --policy quarantine --rua mailto:dmarc@example.org --pct 25 --apply
```

> **Ramp safely.** Only flip to `quarantine` after `p=none` + `rua` reports show
> all your legitimate mail is authenticating with **alignment**. Then widen
> `--pct 25 -> 50 -> 100` over a couple of weeks before ever considering
> `p=reject`. `pct` is honored today but is being removed in the in-progress
> DMARCbis revision - treat it as current best practice, not forever.

---

## Library usage (host apps)

`cloudflare-ops-mcp` exposes clean named exports so a host app can import and wrap it
(add your own auth, approval UI, or multi-tenant token vault) - but it has
**no dependency on any host** and runs perfectly standalone.

```js
import {
  CloudflareClient,
  scanZone,
  applyDnsRecord,
  setDmarcPolicy,
  setupBimi,
  setupEmailRouting,
  planEmailAuth,
  appendAudit,
} from "cloudflare-ops-mcp";

const client = new CloudflareClient(); // reads CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN from env
// (you may also inject { token, fetch } - useful for tests)

// Read-only snapshot:
const snapshot = await scanZone(client, "example.com");

// Plan a DMARC flip (dry-run - writes nothing):
const plan = await setDmarcPolicy(client, "example.com", "quarantine", {
  rua: "mailto:dmarc@example.com",
  pct: 25,
});

// Apply it, then record the change yourself (you supply the timestamp):
const applied = await setDmarcPolicy(
  client,
  "example.com",
  "quarantine",
  { rua: "mailto:dmarc@example.com", pct: 25 },
  { apply: true }
);
appendAudit("./cloudflare-ops-mcp-audit.log", {
  ts: new Date().toISOString(),
  action: "dmarc.policy",
  domain: "example.com",
  record: applied.record,
  before: applied.before,
  after: applied.after,
});
```

Every mutating export is dry-run unless you pass `{ apply: true }`, and pure
logic never calls `Date.now()` - you (or the CLI) supply audit timestamps.

### Public exports

- `CloudflareClient`, `CloudflareError`, `redactToken`
- `resolveZoneId`, `resolveZone`, `scanZone`
- `listRecords`, `findRecord`, `applyDnsRecord`, `deleteDnsRecord`
- `getRoutingStatus`, `enableRouting`, `listDestinations`, `addDestination`,
  `listRules`, `getCatchAll`, `setupEmailRouting`
- `parseDmarc`, `buildDmarc`, `parseSpf`, `getDmarc`, `setDmarcPolicy`,
  `quoteTxt`, `unquoteTxt`
- `parseBimi`, `buildBimi`, `validateBimiSvgUrl`, `setupBimi`
- `planEmailAuth`
- `appendAudit`, `AUDIT_DEFAULT_PATH`

---

## Embedding in a platform

`cloudflare-ops-mcp` is a generic, open tool. A larger platform can `import` it to
automate zone hygiene for its users (wrapping it with per-account tokens and an
approval step), but it is completely standalone - the library and CLI run on
their own with nothing but a scoped Cloudflare token.

---

## Remote MCP server for Cloudflare DNS agents

`worker/` is an optional [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
server (a Cloudflare Worker) that exposes the same engine as tools over a URL, so
any MCP client - an agent, Claude, Cursor - can `scan_zone`, `plan_email_auth`,
`set_dmarc_policy`, `setup_bimi`, etc. by pointing at it.

Four deliberate hardening choices:

- **Every public user has an isolated OAuth connection.** The browser callback generates a random connector ID and a random `cfops_` key. Only the key hash is stored.
- **The Cloudflare token is server-side, never a tool parameter.** It does not travel through MCP tool arguments, Git history, or an agent transcript.
- **Authorization fails closed.** Unknown, missing, revoked, or cross-user connector keys receive `401`. Only the private owner admin key can use the optional fallback token.
- **Every mutating tool is dry-run by default.** The caller must pass `apply: true` after seeing the diff. BIMI keeps its DMARC precondition.

```sh
cd worker
npx wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
npx wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
npx wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI
npx wrangler deploy
```

Users visit `/oauth/cloudflare/start`, complete Cloudflare consent, and copy the one-time connector configuration. The MCP endpoint is `/mcp`. Private self-hosters may additionally set `MCP_ACCESS_KEY` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` as an owner-only fallback; never distribute that admin key.

The core library has **zero dependencies**; the Worker is an optional surface -
you never need it to use the CLI.

## AMH current endeavor: WT

**WT** is AMH's current operator-safety effort: a guarded agent middle layer connecting Cloudflare Agents, MCP, and Wrangler. The goal is to let capable orchestrators and correctly labeled free or paid tool-calling agents inspect, plan, request approval, deploy, verify, and recover—without handing them raw Cloudflare tokens or letting stale agents overwrite newer work.

Watch for the stateful AMH Agent Coordinator, Cache Guardian, Change Guardian, Playwright phone/UI checks, and allowlisted Wrangler doctor, deployment, log, rollback, binding, and storage-health tools. The execution rule stays the same: **check → diff → approve → apply → verify**.
